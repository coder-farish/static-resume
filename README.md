Milestone 1: Static Interactive Resume Builder
Build a static resume using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
 Created a static resume with sections:
o Personal Information (Name, Contact Details, Profile Picture)
o Education
o Skills
o Work Experience
 Used TypeScript to add basic interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the
"Skills" section or other sections.
